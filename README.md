# Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis
This is an analytics project about the bike-share data of a fictional comapny, Cyclystic. The goal of my analysis is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To do this, I analyzed Cyclistic's bike-share data to identify pattern and trends on how Cyclistic members and casual users use its products differently.

### key definitions and notes:
* Casual users: customers who purchas single-ride or full-day passes
* Cyclistic members: customers who purchase annual memberships
* Tools used: **PostgreSQL, Tableau, Google spradsheet, Google search engine!**

### Can everyone use this SQL scrip?
Not quite, some datasets have been pre-transformed using python for faster importation into postgresql so my data cleaning processes might not be a general fit for everyone. 

However, I hope by demonstrating my SQL proficiency via this project, I could also help someone out there who might need a few ideas. Cheers!
