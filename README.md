# Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis
This is an analytics project about the bike-share data of a fictional company, Cyclystic. The goal of my analysis is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To do this, I analyzed Cyclistic's bike-share data to identify patterns and trends in how Cyclistic members and casual users use its products differently.

### Definitions and notes:
* Casual users: customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes
* Cyclistic members: customers who purchase annual memberships
* Tools used: **PostgreSQL, Tableau, Google spreadsheet, Google search engine!**

### Useful links

### Can everyone use this SQL script?
Not quite, some datasets have been pre-transformed using python for faster importation into Postgresql so my data-cleaning processes might not be a general fit for everyone. 

However, I hope by demonstrating my SQL proficiency via this project, I could also help someone out there who might need a few ideas. Cheers!
